# Installation

To use Linticator, you first need to install a Lint from Gimpel. Second, Linticator requires an Eclipse Ganymede (3.4) release of the CDT and Java 1.6 or later, otherwise you won't be able to install Linticator. To install Linticator, open the _Install New Software_ wizard in Eclipse:

To install Linticator, please use the update site ```http://linticator.com/update/v0/``` (case sensitive) and select _Linticator_. If you have Eclipse CDT Helios (3.6) or newer, you can also check the _Linticator Quickfixes_. If you're unsure what Eclipse version you have, you can try to install the _Quickfixes_ and if Eclipse doesn't complain, your version of Eclipse is recent enough.

After the installation, Eclipse will restart itself and a wizard will guide you through the configuration steps. The [User Guide](./user_guide.md) contains further explanations on how Linticator is configured.
