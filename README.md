# Linticator

[Lint](http://www.gimpel.com/html/products.htm) provides valuable *feedback on* programming *style* and common programmer *mistakes*. Our Linticator plug-in for [Eclipse CDT](http://eclipse.org/cdt) runs Lint (PC-lint Plus, Flexe/PC-Lint) and annotates your source code with Lint messages. For some messages, we provide quickfixes that let you *quickly correct a warning*.

## Integrated Lint Documentation

Not sure what a lint message means? Linticator automatically shows you the official [documentation for all Lint messages](/docs/features.md).

## Simpler to Use

Linticator automatically configures Lint with your Eclipse CDT Project settings, unburdening you from manually maintaining the configuration. 

## Cross Platform

Linticator runs on Linux, Mac OS X, Solaris, and Windows. Linticator runs on Eclipse 3.8 (Eclipse 2012 Release "Juno") and later releases (we tested up to Eclipse Oxygen). Linticator is compatible with commercial Eclipse-based IDEs like Freescale's CodeWarrior and can run FlexeLint, PC-lint and PC-lint Plus.
